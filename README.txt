Compares NVIM v0.5.0-dev+1056 vs vim 8.2.2434, current as of 2021-01-31

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Things changed in neovim:

General:
. Neovim is licensed under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license, except for parts
  of Neovim that were contributed under the Vim license.
. Nvim is always "nocompatible"!
. Nvim always builds with all features, in contrast to Vim which may have
  certain features removed/added at compile-time.
. Defaults (option values, etc.) are quite different.
. The "base" (root) directories conform to the XDG Base Directory Specification.
. External plugins run in separate processes. This improves stability and allows
  those plugins to work without blocking the editor. Even "legacy" Python and
  Ruby plugins which use the old Vim interfaces run out-of-process.
. Viminfo text files were replaced with binary (messagepack) ShaDa files. ShaDa
  file format was designed with forward and backward compatibility in mind. More
  error-resilient, keeps search direction (viminfo does not).
. Lua interface (see documentation for details):
    . Lua has direct access to Nvim API via vim.api.
    . Lua package.path and package.cpath are automatically updated according to
      'runtimepath'.
    . :lua print() behavior changed.
    . :lua error() behavior changed.
. If a Python interpreter is available on your $PATH, :python and :python3 are
  always available and may be used simultaneously.
. Replay of a macro recorded during :lmap produces the same actions as when it
  was recorded. In Vim if a macro is recorded while using :lmap'ped keys then
  the behaviour during record and replay differs.
. 'keymap' is implemented via :lmap instead of :lnoremap so that you can use
  macros and 'keymap' at the same time. This also means you can use :imap on the
  results of keys from 'keymap'.
. The jumplist avoids useless/phantom jumps.
. Shell output (:!, :make, etc.) is always routed through the UI, so it cannot
  "mess up" the screen.
. Nvim throttles (skips) messages from shell commands (:!, :grep, :make) if
  there is too much output. No data is lost, this only affects display and
  improves performance. :terminal output is never throttled.
. Visual selection highlights the character at cursor.
. Nvim does not have special t_XX options nor <t_XX> keycodes to configure
  terminal capabilities. Instead Nvim treats the terminal as any other UI, e.g.
  'guicursor' sets the terminal cursor style if possible.
. Nvim will use 256-colour capability on Linux virtual terminals. Vim uses only
  8 colours plus bright foreground on Linux VTs.
. Nvim has no direct connection to the system clipboard. Instead it depends on a
  provider which transparently uses shell commands to communicate with the
  system clipboard or any other clipboard "backend".
. Platform and I/O facilities are built upon libuv.

Functions:
. system() can run {cmd} directly (without 'shell').
. systemlist() can run {cmd} directly (without 'shell').
. mkdir() behaviour changed (in short, permissions and error reporting, but
  see documentation).
. string() behaves differently with nested containers, see documentation.
. json_decode() may output msgpack-special-dict, also in case of duplicate
  keys (no error), accepts only valid JSON.
. json_encode() --- msgpack-special-dict values are accepted, but v:none is not.
. printf() returns something meaningful when used with '%p' argument.
. input() and inputdialog() support for each otherâ€™s features (return on
  cancel and completion respectively).
. input() and inputdialog() support user-defined cmdline highlighting.

Commands:
. :Man --- view manpages (highlighting, completion, locales, and navigation).
  Replaced with Lua implementation in neovim.
. :redir nested in execute() works.
. :echo behaves differently with nested containers, see documentation.
. :doautocmd does not warn about "No matching autocommands".

Highlight groups:
. hl-ColorColumn, hl-CursorColumn are lower priority than most other groups.
. hl-CursorLine is low-priority unless foreground color is set.

Normal mode commands:
. Q is the same as gQ.

Options:
. 'ttimeout', 'ttimeoutlen' behavior was simplified.
. 'term' reflects the terminal type derived from $TERM and other environment
  checks (for debugging only).
. 'maxcombine' (6 is always used).
. 'fsync' behavior was changed.

Startup:
. -e and -es invoke the same "improved Ex mode" as -E and -Es.
. -E and -Es read stdin as text (into buffer 1).
. -es and -Es have improved behavior (auto-quit, skips swap-file dialog).
. -s reads Normal commands from stdin if the script name is "-".
. Reading text (instead of commands) from stdin "--" works by default, "-" file
  is optional, works in more cases: -Es, file args.
. Start Nvim with 'verbose' level 3 to show terminal capabilities: nvim -V3

VimL compatibility:
. Some variables without v: are not aliased to 'v:' variables: count, errmsg,
  shell_error and this_session.
. Does not support :scriptversion!

Other:
. c_CTRL-R pasting a non-special register into cmdline omits the last <CR>.
. Some obsolete features are removed: :fixdel; :helpfind; :mode no longer
  accepts an argument; :open; :Print; :shell.
. Signs are removed if the associated line is deleted.
. v:progpath is always absolute ("full").
. v:windowid is always available (for use by external UIs).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
neovim-only features:

"Major" features (unfinished / unreleased are marked [WIP]):

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Different implementations of similar things:
. Job control APIs are different.
. Nvim's "floating windows" and "virtual texts" APIs are different from "popups"
  and "text properties" APIs in vim.
. Builtin terminal emulators are different.
. Nvim's buffer-local highlighting (api-highlights) plus Extended marks
  (api-extended-marks) APIs are different from vim's text properties.
. Vim has listener functions (callbacks for changes in buffers, see listener_*);
  nvim has buffer update events (nvim_buf_* functions).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Irrelevant to vim or neovim:

Events:
 . UIEnter --- After a UI connects via nvim_ui_attach().
 . UILeave --- After a UI disconnects from Nvim.

Highlight groups:
. hl-StatusLineTerm and hl-StatusLineTermNC are unnecessary in Nvim
  because it supports window-local highlights.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These are incorrectly documented in neovim as differences from vim:

. :autocmd accepts the '++once' flag

Events:
 . Signal --- After Nvim receives a signal (*only* SIGUSR1). Vim: SigUSR1
   -- Documented twice, later as:
      "*SigUSR1* Use |Signal| to detect `SIGUSR1` signal instead."
 . TermOpen --- TerminalOpen in vim.
 . VimResume
 . VimSuspend
